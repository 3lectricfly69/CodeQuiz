# CodeQuiz
When I open this URL, I'm given an option to begin code quiz. Once clicked, timer begins & a question along with options to select appear.  When I answer this question, timer either deducts time with an incorrect response or continues. Once all questions are answered or timer reaches 0, the game is over. Then, you may enter initials / submit score.
